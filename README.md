Sunscreen - 2D Platformer Game
- 

Sunscreeen is a 2D platformer game designed to educate and promote sun safety by encouraging the audience to stay in the shade and wear sunscreen. The goal is to beat each level before the SPF value reaches 0. It starts at 20 and decreases by 1 every quarter second. Umbrellas provide shade such that the SPF value will not decrease, water droplets and rays will wipe away 10 SPF, while coolers and sand castles constitute standard obstacles. The victory condition for each is reaching the car at the end which will activate the next scene, and the victory condition for the game is beating the final level, which has a car that prompts a screen showing that the player has avoided contracting melanoma. The loss condition occurs when the player's SPF reaches 0, prompting the player to restart the game (from level 1, not the tutorial).

Throughout the game the player is presented with a series of micro-choices. Collecting sunscreen will increase their SPF and give them more time to make it to the end of the level, but sometimes the sunscreen is out of the way, requiring the player to spend precious time collecting it while risking colliding with an enemy. We tried to avoid failure states by having the player start in the shade, giving them time to adjust to their 2D surroundings. Also, we added an image to the tutorial that tells the player what keys to use to move around. Hopefully, these factors will keep the player from losing the game without knowing why.

This was a fun project which served as a cool introduction to Serious Games. It was helpful in honing coding skills in C# and in understanding general github workflows.
